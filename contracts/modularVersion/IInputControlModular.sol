 * @dev Check the InputControlModular.sol implementation here:
 * https://github.com/CarlosAlegreUr/InputControl-SmartContract-DesignPattern/blob/main/contracts/modularVersion/InputControlModular.sol
 *
 * @dev Check an usecase at UseCaseContractModular.sol where it's also shown how to mix this
 * contract with other useful ones like Ownable by OpenZeppelin:
